 <!-- JavaScript code will be executed immediately while the page loads into the browser. This is not always what we want the JavaScript code to run. Sometimes we want to execute a script when a page loads other times when the user triggers an event. There are various ways to include JS code in our HTML file.

        Scripts in <head>…</head> section of HTML
        Scripts in <body>…</body> section of HTML
        Scripts in <head>…</head> and <body>…</body> sections of HTML
        Scripts in an external file and then include in <head>…</head> section of HTML -->
